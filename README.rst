An example image showing the connections between models from the `django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion>`_ and `django-notifications <https://github.com/django-notifications/django-notifications>`_ apps and Django's built-in ``auth`` models.

Colored edges illustrate foreign key relations, with arrows pointing from the defining model to the related model, while gray edges illustrate many-to-many relations. Different colors signify the different Django apps, and when relations link between apps the edges are colored with a gradient.
